Declaration of AI Tooling Usage (DAITU)
Version 1.0 — October 2025

PREAMBLE
This Declaration of AI Tooling Usage (“DAITU”) affirms that artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies were used ethically and transparently during the creation, design, and
development of this project. It complements the project’s primary software license by
disclosing the responsible use of AI-assisted systems in its production.

1. PURPOSE
The DAITU promotes transparency, accountability, and integrity in the use of AI systems
within software and creative workflows. It is not a software license and does not grant,
limit, or modify any rights provided by the project’s governing license.

2. SCOPE
This declaration applies to all instances where AI systems contributed to or informed the
development process, including but not limited to:

- Code generation, optimization, or review
- Documentation writing or editing
- Design or visual asset creation
- Testing, automation, or deployment processes
- Research, summarization, or data analysis

All AI-generated or AI-assisted materials were reviewed and approved by human
contributors prior to inclusion in the project.

3. HUMAN OVERSIGHT
Human maintainers retained full creative and technical authority throughout the project
lifecycle. AI systems were used solely as assistive tools, not autonomous agents. All
outputs were manually inspected for accuracy, quality, and ethical compliance to the best 
of the maintainers' ability before acceptance.

4. ETHICAL PRINCIPLES
AI usage in this project adhered to the following principles:

- Transparency: AI involvement is disclosed openly and honestly.
- Accountability: Final responsibility lies with human maintainers.
- Privacy: No confidential or proprietary data was exposed to AI systems.
- Integrity: All outputs were validated for correctness, and legality.
- Fairness: AI usage respected intellectual property and original human authorship.

5. DATA AND MODEL GOVERNANCE
AI tools were employed in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws.
Where possible, privacy-preserving or locally hosted models were used to reduce data
exposure risks and maintain contributor control.

6. LIMITATIONS
AI systems may generate content that is inaccurate, biased, or incomplete. The maintainers
acknowledge these limitations and have exercised due diligence in reviewing all AI-
influenced outputs. No AI system made binding design, policy, or legal decisions on
behalf of the project.

7. AMENDMENTS
This declaration may be revised to reflect new ethical standards, tooling changes, or
project practices. All revisions shall retain version history to ensure traceable
transparency over time.

8. RELEASE OF LIABILITY
This declaration is made in good faith to promote transparency and ethical AI use. The
project authors, maintainers, and contributors make no warranties, express or implied,
regarding the accuracy, safety, or completeness of AI-generated materials.

In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or
other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out
of, or in connection with this declaration or the use of AI systems in the development of
this project.

9. DECLARATION
By including this document, the maintainers affirm:

"AI technologies were used responsibly, transparently, and with human oversight
throughout the development of this project."
